        <p>A Mobile 3D experience allowing users to interact with virtual Coca-Cola products through their mobile devices. Developed in early 2024, for the 2025 "Share a Coke" relaunch. Coca-Cola decided to go in another direction with AR, but it was a great learning experience, and the team and I did some really great work.</p>

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>At Smurfit Westrock, a global leader in paper, packaging, and display solutions, I led and contributed to an innovative augmented reality experience for Coca-Cola's annual campaign pitch. I was brought on to help the company's XR Center of Excellence, to showcase our capabilities in augmented packaging technology while demonstrating a personalized consumer interaction that aligned with Coca-Cola's iconic "Share a Coke" campaign heritage.</p>
        
        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>Coca-Cola approached our sales team seeking innovative ways to engage consumers through their packaging. The challenge was to create an interactive experience that would extend the physical product into the digital realm, allow for personalization, and create shareable moments that could amplify brand reach.</p>
        
        <h3>Solution & Development</h3>
        <p>I recommended and implemented Mattercraft as our development platform, bringing web-based AR capabilities to the project. I met directly and extensively with the Mattercraft team to understand their platform's capabilities and limitations, requesting new features and documentation clairty through bi-weekly meetings over the course of the project. As a consulting contributor with extensive programming experience, I:</p>
        <ul class="tech-list">
            <li>Designed the initial 3D concept in Spline to visualize the interaction flow</li>
            <li>Developed a working MVP in Mattercraft with custom code implementation</li>
            <li>Created a seamless experience from QR code scan to personalized AR visualization</li>
            <li>Implemented name customization functionality that rendered directly onto the virtual bottle</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>The Experience</h3>
        <p>The final product would allow users to:</p>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Scan a QR code on any Coca-Cola bottle</li>
            <li>Enter their name or a custom message in the web app</li>
            <li>See their personalization appear on a 3D Coca-Cola bottle in real-time</li>
            <li>View the customized bottle in augmented reality through their phone camera</li>
            <li>Share their creation with friends or on social media platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
        <ul class="feature-list">
            <li>Platform: Mattercraft (formerly 8th Wall) Web AR</li>
            <li>3D Modeling & Prototyping: Spline</li>
            <li>Web Technologies: JavaScript, Three.js</li>
        </ul>
        
        
        <h3>Impact & Outcome</h3>
        <p>While Coca-Cola ultimately decided to explore different directions for their AR strategy, this project demonstrated our technical capabilities to a major client, established augmented packaging as a viable offering in our solutions portfolio, and provided a foundational template for future interactive packaging experiences.</p>
